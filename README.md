### Accessibility

It provides full keyboard control using standard tab-based navigation, screen-reader (and other AT) support, accessible themes, and other accessibility tweaks.

### Closed-Captions
This is yet no native support for closed captioning on HTML5 <video>, but that shouldn't stop you from providing them.
It supports external SRT files just like desktop media players.

### Transcript
Along with closed captions support, the player provides a dynamic transcript generated from the selected captions.

### Other features
Other notable features include:
* Easy customization and theming
* Fullscreen support
* Buffering indicator
* <audio> support
* Loading indicator
* Remembers volume level using HTML5 LocalStorage
* Easy to use, understand and adapt
